# Week-3-Homework
Week 3 homework
- The motivation behind this project was to create a password generator that creates a random string of characters ranging from 8-128 characters. 
- Utilize Javascript confirm messages to get the password criteria from the user
- Added logic that keeps the user from moving forward if there are inaccurate and/or missing selections for their password (i.e. too few or too many characters, and only select letters) 
- In this project I gained a much better grasp of how to utilize javascript and the function aspect. I also feel a lot more comfortable writing for loops after doing this as well.
